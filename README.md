# hat kid's notoriously smug website

A website that I needed to make for my IT project in school.
Hosted on both Github pages under the domain www.hatkid.ga
          and on Infinityfree server under the domain www.smug.cf
          
Private site (password-protected) can be found at private.smug.cf
Status page for the site, hosted by UptimeRobot, can be found at status.smug.cf
Personal site for myself can be found at www.carnabuci.cf (status at status.carnabuci.cf)

The website contains many images, videos, and music from the indie game A Hat In Time, made by Gears For Breakfast.
All rights belong to Gear For Breakfast for developing the game and its characters. I only developed the website.

The site is licensed under an MIT license. You are free to do basically whatever you want with it.
